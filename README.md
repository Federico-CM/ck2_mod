MassiveCraft: Regalia Reborn — A CK2 Total Conversion

This mod represents a full-stack data-engineering effort to reconstruct the MassiveCraft universe as a playable Crusader Kings II experience. Every component of the original game—map, cultures, religions, titles, histories—has been replaced with carefully extracted and structured lore data.

Scope & Scale

1117 custom provinces mapped from scratch with correct terrain, regions, de jure structure, and pathing.

1000+ hand-validated characters, each integrated with genealogical logic and cross-checked against historical data.

Full system rewrites, including cultural groups, faith systems, title hierarchies, and scripted flavor events.
